"-06_nJnhORg	-06_nJnhORg-5-rgb_front	-06_nJnhORg_15	-06_nJnhORg_15-5-rgb_front	151.25	158.66	So, got in the car, got to the first job, everything went, you know, okay....I was good, but I was still a little bit late."
"-06_nJnhORg	-06_nJnhORg-5-rgb_front	-06_nJnhORg_16	-06_nJnhORg_16-5-rgb_front	158.66	169.51	So, got to the next job, and, you know, moving right along, and I go out to get some cleaning supplies out of my car, and it's locked."
"-06_nJnhORg	-06_nJnhORg-5-rgb_front	-06_nJnhORg_17	-06_nJnhORg_17-5-rgb_front	169.51	186.33	And I go to get my keys out of my little supply box, and they weren't in there, so, I, you know, look around for my keys, and, sure enough, they are locked in my car and I have no extras."
"-06_nJnhORg	-06_nJnhORg-5-rgb_front	-06_nJnhORg_18	-06_nJnhORg_18-5-rgb_front	186.33	196.03	I have none at home, I have no extras, cause I have an extra key in my car, and I have my remote in my car."

"-06_nJnhORg	-06_nJnhORg-5-rgb_front	-06_nJnhORg_2	-06_nJnhORg_2-5-rgb_front	26.3	46.82	You get a late start, you, you know, get to the house and it's an extra big mess, and, you know, you just....one thing after the other just leads to a tough day of...of a long tough day working."
"-06_nJnhORg	-06_nJnhORg-5-rgb_front	-06_nJnhORg_20	-06_nJnhORg_20-5-rgb_front	198.68	210.29	So, I, you know, I had to just fight through the cleaning, and had to have a lock-smith come out and open my doors, and I had to go to another job."

"-06_nJnhORg	-06_nJnhORg-5-rgb_front	-06_nJnhORg_3	-06_nJnhORg_3-5-rgb_front	46.82	66.25	Generally, I...I will schedule two to three houses a day, and if I get a late start then, you know, of course, that just delays the next job, and then the next job, and then it can be seven or eight at night when I get home."
"-06_nJnhORg	-06_nJnhORg-5-rgb_front	-06_nJnhORg_4_5	-06_nJnhORg_4_5-5-rgb_front	66.25	87.92	And one thing that I like...I try not to do is to interfere with my client's family time as well. So, when I get a late start, and maybe I have a horrendous house that I had to clean and...and wasn't planning on it, then my day gets later and I start to intrude into their family time."
"-06_nJnhORg	-06_nJnhORg-5-rgb_front	-06_nJnhORg_6_7	-06_nJnhORg_6_7-5-rgb_front	87.92	98.35	And...and that makes it tough for me, I don't...I don't like to do that at all. So that's probably the hardest part, is, if I don't start my day right."
"-06_nJnhORg	-06_nJnhORg-5-rgb_front	-06_nJnhORg_8	-06_nJnhORg_8-5-rgb_front	98.35	107.61	So, I kind of have to mentally prepare myself for my day, so, that's probably the hardest day for me, is not preparing myself."

"-88OcTs9MPs	-88OcTs9MPs-8-rgb_front	-88OcTs9MPs_2	-88OcTs9MPs_2-8-rgb_front	11.89	24.64	Many paints these days come with a low VOC or a no VOC mixture and it will tell you on the back of the can like this one here says VOC at 132 grams per liter."
"-88OcTs9MPs	-88OcTs9MPs-8-rgb_front	-88OcTs9MPs_3	-88OcTs9MPs_3-8-rgb_front	25.03	50.63	Now VOC stands for volatile organic compounds and that is what is causing the fumes in your house so what you want to do if you have to use some of these paints with VOC in them the best thing to do is to open the windows, all the windows in the house and put a fan on one end of the house so you can draw all the fumes out of the house and try to go to the park for the day or something and get out of the house so you don't have the smell those nasty vapors."
"-88OcTs9MPs	-88OcTs9MPs-8-rgb_front	-88OcTs9MPs_4	-88OcTs9MPs_4-8-rgb_front	50.93	58.44	When you are using those type of paints with VOC in them definitely use some kind of breathing protection that will filter out those kinds of fumes."

"-9GV_-VRpt8	-9GV_-VRpt8-8-rgb_front	-9GV_-VRpt8_1	-9GV_-VRpt8_1-8-rgb_front	22.95	26.37	So the last step that we have is to finish out your free throw."
"-9GV_-VRpt8	-9GV_-VRpt8-8-rgb_front	-9GV_-VRpt8_10	-9GV_-VRpt8_10-8-rgb_front	74.17	83.27	What we see a lot of players do is they'll follow through, but then they'll pull their hand back and again, that's going to pull that basketball back a little bit and not let it go ahead and follow through the proper way."
"-9GV_-VRpt8	-9GV_-VRpt8-8-rgb_front	-9GV_-VRpt8_11	-9GV_-VRpt8_11-8-rgb_front	84.23	91.95	The last thing is we don't want to fall take our shot and fall back off the free throw line."
"-9GV_-VRpt8	-9GV_-VRpt8-8-rgb_front	-9GV_-VRpt8_12	-9GV_-VRpt8_12-8-rgb_front	91.96	95.32	If you shoot and you take a step back, it?s called negative energy."

"-9GV_-VRpt8	-9GV_-VRpt8-8-rgb_front	-9GV_-VRpt8_14	-9GV_-VRpt8_14-8-rgb_front	99.18	108.36	So, remember when making a good free throw shot, its not just the shot, its also how you finish after the free throw that's going to make you a good free throw shooter."
"-9GV_-VRpt8	-9GV_-VRpt8-8-rgb_front	-9GV_-VRpt8_2	-9GV_-VRpt8_2-8-rgb_front	26.37	29.7	If Kyle steps up to the line right here and gets himself ready."

"-9GV_-VRpt8	-9GV_-VRpt8-8-rgb_front	-9GV_-VRpt8_6	-9GV_-VRpt8_6-8-rgb_front	39.26	49.31	But the most important thing is by using your legs, a lot of time you see players come up and shoot their free throw and they stay flat footed and then end up hitting the ball on the front of the rim."
"-9GV_-VRpt8	-9GV_-VRpt8-8-rgb_front	-9GV_-VRpt8_7	-9GV_-VRpt8_7-8-rgb_front	50.13	61.66	What we always want to do is you always want to finish your free throw up on your toes because what that does is when you get up on your toes, that's using the bottom of your leg muscles and its giving you just that extra edge to get that ball up and over the rim."
"-9GV_-VRpt8	-9GV_-VRpt8-8-rgb_front	-9GV_-VRpt8_8	-9GV_-VRpt8_8-8-rgb_front	63.73	69.52	The other thing you want to make sure and do is always follow through and end up out in front of you."

"1REXebJzhBs	1REXebJzhBs-5-rgb_front	1REXebJzhBs_13	1REXebJzhBs_13-5-rgb_front	84.5	98.69	Next, you need to activate the 9-1-1 system and summon help, and then, advance life support treatment can be initiated on this patient."
"1REXebJzhBs	1REXebJzhBs-5-rgb_front	1REXebJzhBs_2	1REXebJzhBs_2-5-rgb_front	16.65	25.23	To do that, if you find a person laying on the ground or sitting in their chair, that appears to be asleep, see if they can wake up."
"1REXebJzhBs	1REXebJzhBs-5-rgb_front	1REXebJzhBs_3	1REXebJzhBs_3-5-rgb_front	25.25	29.22	You can do that by shaking them or shouting at them."

"1REXebJzhBs	1REXebJzhBs-5-rgb_front	1REXebJzhBs_5	1REXebJzhBs_5-5-rgb_front	40.17	41.9	Check for a pulse."

"1REXebJzhBs	1REXebJzhBs-5-rgb_front	1REXebJzhBs_8	1REXebJzhBs_8-5-rgb_front	61.52	71.2	When you have identified somebody that is in cardiac arrest, CPR needs to be started immediately."

"1fdMM1LuAsY	1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front	1fdMM1LuAsY_1	1fdMM1LuAsY_1-8-rgb_front	8.89	15.95	The first thing that you want to do when tightening or loosening your breaks is decide where exactly it's comfortable for you to pull on the lever."
"1fdMM1LuAsY	1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front	1fdMM1LuAsY_10	1fdMM1LuAsY_10-8-rgb_front	58.01	68.83	And then also a secondary method to adjust the tightness or looseness of your brakes, is to come back to the actual caliper itself, here on the back of the bike."
"1fdMM1LuAsY	1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front	1fdMM1LuAsY_11	1fdMM1LuAsY_11-8-rgb_front	68.99	74.49	With a five millimeter allen key, you can actually adjust the pull right at the brake caliper itself."
"1fdMM1LuAsY	1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front	1fdMM1LuAsY_12	1fdMM1LuAsY_12-8-rgb_front	75.41	89.07	So you can just adjust how much cable is being pulled right at the caliper, and it's kind of a hit and miss since you can't be pulling and adjust at the same time."
"1fdMM1LuAsY	1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front	1fdMM1LuAsY_13	1fdMM1LuAsY_13-8-rgb_front	89.3	92.58	So you kind of have to make an adjustment, then check you pull."
"1fdMM1LuAsY	1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front	1fdMM1LuAsY_14	1fdMM1LuAsY_14-8-rgb_front	92.93	98.3	And that seems a little bit too tight, so maybe you let just a little bit more out."
"1fdMM1LuAsY	1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front	1fdMM1LuAsY_15	1fdMM1LuAsY_15-8-rgb_front	105.6	105.86	There."

"1fdMM1LuAsY	1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front	1fdMM1LuAsY_18	1fdMM1LuAsY_18-8-rgb_front	117.75	119.88	And in this case we have a disc rotor, and so it sounds good."
"1fdMM1LuAsY	1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front	1fdMM1LuAsY_19	1fdMM1LuAsY_19-8-rgb_front	120.11	123.52	There's no pad rubbing, the wheel isn't dragging at all."
